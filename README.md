# css-grid

- CSS Grid is a powerful tool that CSS gives us to easily align items and create two-dimensional layouts
    - Grid and Flexbox are both part of CSS and can both be used in similar ways
    - Flexbox was created first and has a bit more browser compatibility

- Grid Containers & Grid Items
    - Grid Container is the element that holds grid items. Grid items are direct children of grid containers.
    - A container is created with (display: grid)

# Grid Container Properties
    - grid-template-columns
    - grid-template-rows
    - grid-gap
    - grid-auto-rows
    - grid-auto-columns
    - grid-template-areas
    - justify-content
    - align-items

# Grid Item Properties
    - grid-column
    - grid-row
    - grid-area
    - align-self
    - justify-self

- Unlike Flexbox, which is one-dimensional and can be either a row or column.
- CSS Grid allows us to create two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns.
- with CSS Grid we can build more sophisticated layouts as we can have rows and columns in same grid container.
